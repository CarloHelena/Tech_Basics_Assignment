She was completly unharmed and at first showed no signs of mental problems, except that she couldn't remember anyhting from the last quarter of the year.\nThe little girl went back to school just one day after beeing back home and everything seemed normal until some kids in the class of the little girl got sick.\nFrom one day to another, they lost their ability to speak. In addition, they had anxiety attacks and always their face was contorted with pain. No doctor knew what to do...\nAt first many children fell ill, but when the first parent fell sick, everyone knew, that it was a matter of time when the whole town would be infected. Panic broke out. Parents needed to decide - stay with their infected children or leave before it was too late. Many people left. But some stayed...\nAnd they still 'live' there. But they became something similar to zombies. Until now, they couldn't leave because of the wall the fled inhabitants built around their hometown, but it's getting ramsackle...\nWe need to get in and find the cause for the virus or whatever it may be, before they break out and infect all the adjoining villages.", "I understand, let's just get in there and try to get out alive."
